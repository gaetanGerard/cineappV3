# What's for the future ?

I plan in the future to implement 
- the possibility to watch the trailer of the movie, the series trailer or episode trailer
- The possibility for a logged in user to post download link of a series or movie (with some condition and restriction)
- The possibility of a logged in user to see the download Link
